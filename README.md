# Adamite_VSCode

Description:
- Hello! Glad to see you on this page. This extension was made to allow developers to store selected peices of code and annotate in an interactive manner. Interactive in the sense that other uses can view and act upon annotations you have made. Go ahead, try it out!!

Important checks:
- Make sure to have the latest version of VSCode to test extension
- Use npm installs over yarn installs in the case it requires any modules on your system
