# Catseye in Visual Studio Code



Annotate your code like you annotate in Google Docs! Keep track of and share information with your teammates, all while staying in the code and not cluttering your code with extra comments.

Catseye can help you...
- **Keep Track of Code-Related Information**. Keep track of your questions, bugs, and tasks by annotating the code you care about.
- **Navigate Your Code Easily**. Catseye's annotation code anchors can be used as bookmarks for the parts of your code you want to go to.
- **Collaborate**. Keep your conversations in the code with annotations -- ask questions, reply with answers, document issues, all while staying in the context of the code.
- **Manage Your Information**. Catseye provides a suite of features to make finding and managing your annotations easy -- merge, filter, search and sort so you can find the information that's important to you.
